# 🐧 My Linux Learning Journey

This repository is a reflection of my journey learning Linux — from mastering the terminal to working with files, directories, and permissions. Whether you're a beginner or revisiting Linux, I hope you find something helpful here.

## 📘 What I've Learned

### 📁 File and Directory Management
- Navigate the Linux filesystem using `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`
- Create and remove files/directories with `touch`, `mkdir`, and `rm`
- Move and copy files using `mv` and `cp`
- Use wildcards (`*.txt`) to perform batch operations

### 🔐 Permissions and Ownership
- Understand Linux file permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x)
- Modify permissions using `chmod`
- Change file ownership with `chown` and group ownership with `chgrp`
- Use `ls -l` to view permission and ownership details

### 🧭 Navigation and Shortcuts
- Understand absolute vs relative paths
- Use `.` and `..` to move within directory levels
- Combine commands using `&&`, `;`, and pipelines (`|`)

### 🔎 Text and File Utilities
- Read file contents with `cat`, `less`, and `head`/`tail`
- Search for words using `grep`
- Redirect output using `>` (overwrite) and `>>` (append)
- Use `echo` and `printf` to output text and variables

### 📦 Basic Archiving and Compression
- Create compressed archives with `tar`, `gzip`, and `zip`
- Extract archives using `tar -xvzf` or `unzip`

### 🛠 Useful Daily Commands
- `clear` — Clear the terminal screen
- `history` — Show command history
- `man` — Access manual pages (e.g., `man ls`)
